# eval_polygon.py
- 'eval_polygon.py' has been developed from the original 'eval.py' (yolact: https://github.com/dbolya/yolact)
- Please use splitted geotiff.
- [X, Y, X_len, Y_len, areaBox, class, maskX, maskY, maskArea, maskMaxArea, maskArklen, polygon] for each object are evaluated using gdal function and cv2, and saved as 'output/result.txt'.
	- [X, Y]: The coordinates of bounding box (bbox) centroids.
	- [X_len, Y_len]: The length of bbox (x and y).
	- [areaBox]: The area of bbox.
	- [maskX, maskY]: The coordinates of mask centroids.
	- [maskArea, maskMaxArea]: The area of mask. If the region is devided into two or more, [maskArea] is total area and [maskMaxArea] represents the area of the largest region.
	- [maskArklen]: Perimeter of mask region.
	- [polygon]: Polygon contours of detect objects. It's written in WKT (Well-Known Text).
